# Generative Adversarial Networks in PyTorch

Deep neural networks are used mainly for supervised learning: classification or regression. Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs, however, use neural networks for a very different purpose: Generative modeling

> Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset. - [Source](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-generative-adversarial-networks-gans/)

To get a sense of the power of generative models, just visit [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com). Every time you reload the page, a new image of a person's face is generated on the fly. The results are pretty fascinating:

Generative Adversarial Network takes the following approach:

There are two neural networks: a *Generator* and a *Discriminator*. The generator generates a "fake" sample given a random vector/matrix, and the discriminator attempts to detect whether a given sample is "real" (picked from the training data) or "fake" (generated by the generator). Training happens in tandem: we train the discriminator for a few epochs, then train the generator for a few epochs, and repeat. This way both the generator and the discriminator get better at doing their jobs. 

GANs however, can be notoriously difficult to train, and are extremely sensitive to hyperparameters, activation functions and regularization. In this tutorial, we train a GAN to generate images of anime characters' faces.

We use the [Anime Face Dataset](https://github.com/Mckinsey666/Anime-Face-Dataset), which consists of over 63,000 cropped anime faces. Note that generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task, so the images do not have any labels. Most of the code in this tutorial is based on this notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/splcher/starter-anime-face-dataset





## Discriminator Network

The discriminator takes an image as input, and tries to classify it as "real" or "generated". In this sense, it's like any other neural network. We'll use a convolutional neural networks (CNN) which outputs a single number output for every image. We'll use stride of 2 to progressively reduce the size of the output feature map.

1. Note that we're using the Leaky ReLU activation for the discriminator.

>  Different from the regular ReLU function, Leaky ReLU allows the pass of a small gradient signal for negative values. As a result, it makes the gradients from the discriminator flows stronger into the generator. Instead of passing a gradient (slope) of 0 in the back-prop pass, it passes a small negative gradient.  - [Source](https://sthalles.github.io/advanced_gans/)

Just like any other binary classification model, the output of the discriminator is a single number between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the probability of the input image being real i.e. picked from the original dataset.

Let's move the discriminator model to the chosen device.




## Generator Network

The input to the generator is typically a vector or a matrix of random numbers (referred to as a latent tensor) which is used as a seed for generating an image. The generator will convert a latent tensor of shape `(128, 1, 1)` into an image tensor of shape `3 x 28 x 28`. To achive this, we'll use the `ConvTranspose2d` layer from PyTorch, which is performs to as a *transposed convolution* (also referred to as a *deconvolution*).

We use the TanH activation function for the output layer of the generator.

<img src="https://nic.schraudolph.org/teach/NNcourse/figs/tanh.gif" width="420" >

> "The ReLU activation (Nair & Hinton, 2010) is used in the generator with the exception of the output layer which uses the Tanh function. We observed that using a bounded activation allowed the model to learn more quickly to saturate and cover the color space of the training distribution. Within the discriminator we found the leaky rectified activation (Maas et al., 2013) (Xu et al., 2015) to work well, especially for higher resolution modeling." - [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41489907/generative-adversarial-networks-tanh)


Note that since the outputs of the TanH activation lie in the range `[-1,1]`, we have applied the similar transformation to the images in the training dataset. Let's generate some outputs using the generator and view them as images by transforming and denormalizing the output.





## Discriminator Training

Since the discriminator is a binary classification model, we can use the binary cross entropy loss function to quantify how well it is able to differentiate between real and generated images.

Here are the steps involved in training the discriminator.

- We expect the discriminator to output 1 if the image was picked from the real MNIST dataset, and 0 if it was generated using the generator network. 

- We first pass a batch of real images, and compute the loss, setting the target labels to 1. 

- Then we pass a batch of fake images (generated using the generator) pass them into the discriminator, and compute the loss, setting the target labels to 0. 

- Finally we add the two losses and use the overall loss to perform gradient descent to adjust the weights of the discriminator.

It's important to note that we don't change the weights of the generator model while training the discriminator (`opt_d` only affects the `discriminator.parameters()`)




## Generator Training

Since the outputs of the generator are images, it's not obvious how we can train the generator. This is where we employ a rather elegant trick, which is to use the discriminator as a part of the loss function. Here's how it works:

- We generate a batch of images using the generator, pass the into the discriminator.

- We calculate the loss by setting the target labels to 1 i.e. real. We do this because the generator's objective is to "fool" the discriminator. 

- We use the loss to perform gradient descent i.e. change the weights of the generator, so it gets better at generating real-like images to "fool" the discriminator.

Here's what this looks like in code.

We'll use a fixed set of input vectors to the generator to see how the individual generated images evolve over time as we train the model. Let's save one set of images before we start training our model.





## Full Training Loop

Let's define a `fit` function to train the discriminator and generator in tandem for each batch of training data. We'll use the Adam optimizer with some custom parameters (betas) that are known to work well for GANs. We will also save some sample generated images at regular intervals for inspection.
